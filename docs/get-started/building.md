2. After cloning, add a file called `.env`, then add an environment variable named `GATSBY_API_URL` with a value of your API URL you configured on the bot.
   Please note that you may need to restart or log out for this change to take effect.
3. Open a command line window and `cd` to Website. Make sure that `package.json` exists in the selected folder.
